# CHATBOT-WITH-PYTHON

🤖 Chatbot Models and Training 🧠

This repository contains code and data for training two types of chatbots:

📜 An Intent-Based Chatbot that understands and responds to predefined user intents.
🗣️ An NLP-Based Chatbot that utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques.

🤖 Intent-Based Chatbot Code 📜

intents.json 🗂️

Description: This JSON file defines the intents for an intent-based chatbot. Each intent includes patterns (input queries), responses, and a tag.
Usage: Used to define chatbot behavior and responses based on user input.
chatbot_training.py 📋

Description: A Python script for training a neural network-based chatbot using Keras and TensorFlow. The script loads intent data from intents.json, preprocesses it, creates a training dataset, builds a neural network model, trains the model, and saves it.
Usage: Execute this script to train and save a chatbot model.
chatbot_model.h5 💾

Description: A trained neural network model for the chatbot, saved in HDF5 format.
Usage: Loaded by the chatbot application for natural language understanding and response generation.
words.pkl and classes.pkl 🗃️

Description: These binary files store vocabulary (unique lemmatized words) and classes (intent labels) used in chatbot training.
Usage: Loaded during training and by the chatbot application for text preprocessing and intent classification.

The repository includes scripts for training the chatbots, saved model files, and example interaction code. You can use these resources to build your own chatbot or experiment with chatbot training.
